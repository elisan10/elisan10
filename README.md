### Hi! 

Welcome to my github profile! I am currently finishing up a Full-Stack Web Development program and am super excited to get my hands in the field! 

Here are a few things about me:
1. I am currently transitioning from good ole South Dakota to sunny California.
2. Before Web Development I worked at Starbucks and one day hope to own a coffee shop.
3. I've jumped from studying Social Work to Youth Ministry to Media Studies to Theology in the span of 5 years.
